# What is it?

My Linux config files so I can pull them anywhere and don't lose them.

# Usage

The files are organized for use by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
Each directory can be copied directly to your home or symlinked with stow.

    cp -r vim/* ~

or

    stow vim

# New Machine Checklist:
